This package was build on a pair of Debian 7 32/64-bits Docker containers,  
running on an OS X machine, using the script provided in the GNU ARM Eclipse 
Second Edition git. 

To build the latest version of the package please use the script from:

  curl -L https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuarmeclipse/se/ci/develop/tree/scripts/build-openocd.sh?format=raw \
    -o ~/Downloads/build-openocd.sh

To run it, first be sure that the packages required in the Prerequisites 
section are installed, then download the script and execute it with bash:

  bash ~/Downloads/build-openocd.sh --debian32 --debian64

The output of the build script are two .tgz files in the 
${WORK_FOLDER}/output folder.

The script was developed on OS X 10.10.3 with MacPorts 2.3.3, but also runs
on most GNU/Linux distributions supporting Docker.

Up-to-date build information is available in the GNU ARM Eclipse project wiki:

Many thanks to my friend Dan Maiorescu for his major contributions 
to this project.
