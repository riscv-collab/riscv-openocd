### Prerequisites

In case you encounter problems while using the **GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD**, please consider the following:

* [ ] read the documentation pages carefully
* [ ] check the [Known issues](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/support/known-issues/)
* [ ] check the [FAQ](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/support/faq/)
* [ ] check the [GNU ARM Eclipse forum](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/support/forum/) for similar problems
* [ ] check the GitHub Issues [tracker](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/openocd/issues/)

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use cases, if you have custom 
configurations, and generally if you have any experience that you want to share with others, 
use the [GNU ARM Eclipse forum](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/support/forum/).

Just [register](http://www.element14.com/community/create-account.jspa) to element14 community and use the [Start a discussion](http://www.element14.com/community/discussion/create.jspa?containerID=2436&containerType=700) link, with the OpenOCD category.

If you are convinced that you identified a bug (if you have doubts, use the forum), or you have a 
pertinent suggestion how to enhance GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD, continue and register
an issue, but please keep in mind that GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD only repacks the binaries, without significant changes, and functional changes should normally be addressed to the original project developers.
