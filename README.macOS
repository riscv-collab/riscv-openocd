Building OpenOCD for macOS
--------------------------

There are a few prerequisites you will need first:

- Xcode (install from the AppStore)
- Command Line Tools (install from Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads)
- Gentoo Prefix (http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/bootstrap.xml)
  or
- Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/)
  or
- MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/install.php)


If you're building manually you need Texinfo version 5.0 or later. The
simplest way to get it is to use Homebrew (brew install texinfo) and
then ``export PATH=/usr/local/opt/texinfo/bin:$PATH``.


With Gentoo Prefix you can build the release version or the latest
devel version (-9999) the usual way described in the Gentoo
documentation. Alternatively, install the prerequisites and build
manually from the sources.


With Homebrew you can either run:
  brew install [--HEAD] openocd (where optional --HEAD asks brew to
                                 install the current git version)
    or
  brew install libtool automake libusb [libusb-compat] [hidapi] [libftdi]
    (to install the needed dependencies and then proceed with the
     manual building procedure)


For building with MacPorts you need to run:
  sudo port install libtool automake autoconf pkgconfig \
    libusb [libusb-compat] [libftdi1]

You should also specify LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS to allow configure to use
MacPorts' libraries, so run configure like this:
  LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include ./configure [options]


See README for the generic building instructions.

If you're using a USB adapter and have a driver kext matched to it,
you will need to unload it prior to running OpenOCD. E.g. with Apple
driver (OS X 10.9 or later) for FTDI run:
  sudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI
for FTDI vendor driver use:
  sudo kextunload FTDIUSBSerialDriver.kext
