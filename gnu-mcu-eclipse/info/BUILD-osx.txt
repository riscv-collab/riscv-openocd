This package was build on an OS X machine, using the script provided in
the GNU MCU Eclipse build-scripts git.

To build the latest version of the package please use the script from:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/build-scripts.git \
~/Downloads/build-scripts.git
```

To run it, first be sure that the packages required in the Prerequisites 
section are installed, then download the script and execute it with bash:

```bash
$ bash ~/Downloads/build-scripts.git/scripts/build-openocd.sh --osx
```

The output of the build script is a `.pkg` install and a `*.tgz` 
in the `${WORK_FOLDER}/output` folder.

The script was developed on OS X 10.12 with Homebrew. Running it on other 
versions is possible, but might require some adjustments.

Up-to-date build information is available in the GNU MCU Eclipse project web:

Many thanks to my friend Dan Maiorescu for his major contributions 
to this project.
