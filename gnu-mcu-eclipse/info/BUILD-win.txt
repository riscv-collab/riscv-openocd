This package was build with MinGW-w64 on a Debian 8 64-bits Docker container,  
running on an OS X machine, using the script provided in the GNU MCU Eclipse 
build-scripts git. 

To build the latest version of the package please use the script from:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/build-scripts.git \
~/Downloads/build-scripts.git
```

To run it, first be sure that the packages required in the Prerequisites 
section are installed, then download the script and execute it with bash:

```bash
$ bash ~/Downloads/build-scripts.git/scripts/build-openocd.sh --win32 --win64
```

The output of the build script are two `setup.exe` files in the 
`${WORK_FOLDER}/output` folder.

The script was developed on OS X 10.12 with Homebrew, but also runs
on most GNU/Linux distributions supporting Docker.

Up-to-date build information is available in the GNU MCU Eclipse project web:

Many thanks to my friend Dan Maiorescu for his major contributions 
to this project.
