/** @page releases Release Processes

This page provides an introduction to the OpenOCD Release Processes:

- @ref releasewhy - Explain the motivations for producing
  releases on a regular basis.
- @ref releasewho - Describes the responsibilities and
  authority required to produce official OpenOCD releases.
- @ref releasewhen - Provides guidelines for scheduling
  activities for each release cycle.
- @ref releasehow - Outlines all of the steps for the
  processes used to produce and release the package source archives.
- @ref releasescriptcmds - Introduces the automated @c release.sh script.

@section releasewhy Why Produce Releases?

The OpenOCD maintainers produce <i>releases</i> periodically for many
reasons.  This section provides the key reasons for making releases on a
regular basis and why a set of <i>release processes</i> should be used
to produce them.

At any time, <i>source archives</i> can be produced by running
<code>make dist</code> in the OpenOCD project tree.  With the 0.2.0
release, this command will package the tree into several popular archive
formats: <code>openocd-\<version\>.{tar.gz,tar.bz2,zip}</code>.  If
produced properly, these files are suitable for release to the public.

When properly versioned and released for users, these archives present
several important advantages compared to using the source repository
(including snapshots downloaded from that repository using gitweb):

-# They allow others to package and distribute the code using
   consistent version labels.  Users won't normally need to care
   whose package they use, just the version of OpenOCD.
-# They contain a working configure script and makefiles, which
   were produced as part of creating the archive.
-# Because they have been formally released by the project, users
   don't need to try a random work-in-process revision.  Releasing
   involves spending some time specifically on quality improvments,
   including bugfixing source code and documentation.
-# They provide developers with the flexibility needed to address
   larger issues, which sometimes involves temporary breakage.

Hopefully, this shows several good reasons to produce regular releases,
but the release processes were developed with some additional design
goals in mind.  Specifically, the releases processes should have the
following properties:

-# Produce successive sets of archives cleanly and consistently.
-# Implementable as a script that automates the critical steps.
-# Prevent human operators from producing broken packages, when possible.
-# Allow scheduling and automation of building and publishing milestones.

The current release processes are documented in the following sections.
They attempt to meet these design goals, but improvements may still
need to be made.

@subsection version_labels Version Labels

Users can display the OpenOCD version string in at least two
ways.  The command line <code>openocd -v</code> invocation
displays it; as does the Tcl <code>version</code> command.

Labels for released versions look like <em>0.3.0</em>, or
<em>0.3.0-rc1</em> for a preliminary release.
Non-released (developer) versions look like <em>0.3.0-dev</em>,
or <em>0.3.0-rc1-dev</em>.
In all cases, additional tags may be appended to those base
release version labels.

The <code>tools/release/version.sh</code> script is used to
manipulate version IDs found in the source tree.

@subsubsection releaseversions Release Versions and Tags

The OpenOCD version string is composed of three numeric components
separated by two decimal points: @c x.y.z, where @c x is the @a major
version number, @c y is the @a minor number, and @c z is the @a micro.
For any <em>bug-fix</em> release, the micro version number will be non-zero
(<code>z > 0</code>).  For a <i>minor release</i>, the micro version
number will be zero (<code>z = 0</code>).  For a <i>major releases</i>,
the minor version will @a also be zero (<code>y = 0, z = 0</code>).

After these required numeric components, release version strings
may contain tags such as as <em>-rc1</em> or <em>-rc2</em>.
These 'rc' tags indicate "release candidate" versions of the package.
Like major/minor/micro numbers, these are updated
as part of the release process.

The release process includes version number manipulations to the tree
being released, ensuring that all numbers are incremented (or rolled
over) at the right time and in the proper locations of the repository.
One of those manipulations creates a repository tag matching that
release's version label.

@subsubsection releaseversionsdist Packager Versions

Distributors of patched versions of OpenOCD are encouraged to extend the
version string with a unique version tag when producing external
releases, as this helps to identify your particular distribution series.
Knowing that a release has such patches can be essential to tracking
down and fixing bugs.

Packager version tags should always be suffixes to the version
code from the OpenOCD project, signifying modifications to the
original code base.  Each packager release should have a unique
version.

For example, the following command will add a 'foo' tag to the
configure.ac script of a local copy of the source tree, giving
a version label like <em>0.3.0-foo</em>:

@code
tools/release/version.sh tag add foo
@endcode

This command will modify the configure.ac script in your working copy
only.  After running the @c bootstrap sequence, the tree can be patched
and used to produce your own derived versions.  You might check that
change into a private branch of your git tree, along with the other
patches you are providing.

You can also "bump" those tags (so "foo1" becomes "foo2" etc)
each time a derived package is released, incrementing the tag's
version to facilitate tracking the changes you have distributed.

@code
tools/release/version.sh bump tag foo
@endcode

Of course, any patches in your branches must be provided to
your customers, and be in conformance with the GPL.  In most
cases you should also work to merge your improvements to the
mainline tree.

@subsubsection version_tags Development Versions and Tags

Everything except formal releases should have the tag <em>-dev</em>
in their version number.  This helps developers identify reports
created from non-release versions, and it can be detected and
manipulated by the release script.  Specifically, this tag will be
removed and re-added during the release process; it should never be
manipulated by developers in submitted patches.

Versions built from developer trees may have additional tags.
Trees built from git snapshots have <em>snapshot</em> tags.
When built from a "live" git tree, tags specify
specific git revisions:

0.3.0-rc1-dev-00015-gf37c9b8-dirty

indicates a development tree based on git revison f37c9b8
(a truncated version of a SHA1 hash) with some non-git
patches applied (the <em>dirty</em> tag).  This information
can be useful when tracking down bugs.
(Note that at this writing, the tags do not directly
correspond to <code>git describe</code> output.  The
hash ID can be used with <code>git show</code>, but
the relevant repository tag isn't <em>0.3.0-rc1-dev</em>;
this might change in the future.)

@section releasewho Release Manager

OpenOCD archive releases will be produced by an individual filling the
role of <i>Release Manager</i>, hereafter abbreviated as <i>RM</i>.  This
individual determines the schedule and executes the release processes
for the community.

@subsection releasewhohow RM Authority

Each release requires one individual to fulfill the RM role; however,
graceful transitions of this authority may take place at any time.  The
current RM may transfer their authority to another contributor in a post
to the OpenOCD development mailing list.  Such delegation of authority
must be approved by the individual that will receive it and the
community of maintainers.  Initial arrangements with the new RM should
be made off-list, as not every contributor wants these responsibilities.

@subsection releasewhowhat RM Responsibilities

In addition to the actual process of producing the releases, the RM is
responsible for keeping the community informed of all progress through
the release cycle(s) being managed.  The RM is responsible for managing
the changes to the package version, though the release tools should
manage the tasks of adding or removing any required development branch
tags and incrementing the version.

These responsibilities matter most towards the end of the release
cycle, when the RM creates the first RC and all contributors enter
a quality-improvement mode.  The RM works with other contributors
to make sure everyone knows what kinds of fixes should merge, the
status of major issues, and the release timetable.

In particular, the RM has the final decision on whether a given
bug should block the release.

@section releasewhen Release Schedule

The OpenOCD release process must be carried out on a periodic basis, so
the project can realize the benefits presented in answer to the question,
@ref releasewhy.

Starting with the 0.2.0 release, the OpenOCD project expects to produce
new releases every few months.
Bug fix releases could be provided more frequently.  These release
schedule goals may be adjusted in the future, after the project
maintainers and distributors receive feedback and experience.

More importantly, the statements made in this section do not create an
obligation by any member of the OpenOCD community to produce new
releases on regular schedule, now or in the future.

@subsection releasewhenexample Sample Schedule

The RM must pro-actively communicate with the community from the
beginning of the development cycle through the delivery of the new
release.  This section presents guidelines for scheduling key points
where the community must be informed of changing conditions.

If Tn is the time of release n, then the following schedule
might describe some key T0-to-T1 release cycle milestones.

- T0 ... End of T0 release cycle. T1 cycle starts, with merge
  window opening.  Developers begin to merge queued work.
- <em>... several weeks of merge window ...</em>
- RC1 ... Close mainline to new work.  Produce RC1
  release, begin testing phase; developers are in "bugfix mode",
  all other work is queued; send out planned endgame schedule.
- RC2 ... Produce RC2 and send schedule update to
  mailing list, listing priorities for remaining fixes
- <em>... more RC milestones, until ready ...</em>
- T1: End of T1 release cycle. T2 cycle starts, with merge
  window opening.  Developers begin to merge queued work.

Note that until it happens, any date for T1 is just a goal.
Critical bugs prevent releases from happening.  We are just
beginning to use this window-plus-RCs process, so the lengths
of the merge windows versus the RC phase is subject to change.
Most projects have RC phases of a month or more.

Some additional supplemental communication will be desirable.  The above
list omits the step-by-step instructions to daily release management.
Individuals performing release management need to have the ability to
interact proactively with the community as a whole, anticipating when
such interaction will be required and giving ample notification.

The next section explains why the OpenOCD project allows significant
flexibility in the part of the development that precedes the release
process.

@subsection releasewhenflex Schedule Flexibility

The Release Manager should attempt to follow the guidelines in this
document, but the process of scheduling each release milestone should be
community driven at the start.  Features that don't complete before
the merge window closes can be held (perhaps in some branch) until
the next merge window opens, rather than delaying the release cycle.

The Release
Manager cannot schedule the work that will be done on the project,
when it will be submitted, reviewed, and deemed suitable to be committed.
That is, the RM cannot act as a priest in a cathedral; OpenOCD uses
the bazaar development model.  The release schedule must adapt
continuously in response to changes in the rate of work.
Fewer releases may be
required if developers contribute less patches, and more releases may be
desirable if the project continues to grow and experience high rates of
community contribution.  During each cycle, the RM should be tracking
the situation and gathering feedback from the community.

@section releasehow Release Process: Step-by-Step

The release process is not final; it may need more iterations
to work out bugs.
While there are release scripts, key steps require community
support; the Release Manager isn't the only participant.

The following steps should be followed to produce each release:

-# Produce final patches using a local clone of mainline.  Nobody
   except the RM should be committing anything.  <em>Everyone with commit
   privileges needs to know and agree to this in advance!</em>  Even the RM
   only commits a handful of updates as part of the release process
   itself ... to files which are part of the version identification scheme
   or release process; and to create the version tag; and then to open the
   merge window for the next release cycle.
  -# Finalize @c the NEWS file to describe the changes in the release
    - This file is used to automatically post "blurbs" about the project.
    - This material should have been produced during the development cycle,
      by adding items for each @c NEWS-worthy contribution, when committed
      during the merge window.  (One part of closing the merge window, by
      opening the RC phase of the release, is the commitment to hold all
      further such contributions until the next merge window opens.)
    - The RM should make sure nothing important was omitted, as part of
      the RC1 cycle.  From then on, no more updates to NEWS content should
      be needed (except to seed the process for the next release, or maybe
      if a significant and longstanding bug is fixed late in the RC phase).
  -# Bump library version if our API changed (not yet required)
  -# Update and commit the final package version in @c configure.ac:
     (The <code>tools/release/version.sh</code> script might help ensure
     the versions are named properly.):
    -# Remove @c -dev tag.
    -# Update any @c -rc tag:
      - If producing the final release from an -rc series, remove it
      - If producing the first RC in a series, add rc1
      - If producing the next RC in a series, bump the rc number
    -# Commit that version change, with a good descriptive comment.
  -# Create a git tag for the final commit, with a tag name matching
     the version string in <code>configure.ac</code> (including <em>-rcN</em>
     where relevant):
@verbatim
PACKAGE_VERSION="x.y.z"
PACKAGE_TAG="v${PACKAGE_VERSION}"
git tag -m "The openocd-${PACKAGE_VERSION} release." "${PACKAGE_TAG}"
@endverbatim
  -# Do not push those changes to mainline yet; only builds using the
     source archives you will be creating should ever be labeled as
     official releases (with no "-dev" suffix).  Since mainline is a
     development tree, these will be pushed later, as part of opening
     the merge window for the next release cycle (restoring the "-dev"
     suffix for that next release.)  Those version and tag updates are
     the last ones to be included in the release being made.
-# Produce the release files, using the local clone of the source
  tree which holds the release's tag and updated version in
  @c configure.ac ... this is used only to produce the release, and
  all files should already be properly checked out.
  -# Run <code>tools/release.sh package</code> to produce the
	source archives.  This automatically bootstraps and
	configures the process.
  -# Run <code>tools/release.sh stage</code> to create an @c archives
	directory with the release data, including MD5 and SHA1
	checksum files.
  -# Sanity check at least one of those archives, by extracting and
     configuring its contents, using them to build a copy of OpenOCD,
     and verifying that the result prints the correct release version
     in its startup banner.  (For example,
     "configure --enable-parport"
     then "make" and run "src/openocd -v" as a sanity check.)
  -# Run <code>make docs</code> to create the
     documentation which will be published.
-# Upload packages and post announcements of their availability:
  -# Release packages into files section of project sites:
    - SF.net:
     -# Under "Project Admin", use the "File Manager"
     -# Create a new folder under "openocd" named "${PACKAGE_VERSION}"
     -# Upload the @c NEWS file and mark it as the release notes.
     -# Upload the three source archive files, using the Web interface,
     	into that folder.  Verify the upload worked OK by checking the
	MD5 and SHA1 checksums computed by SourceForge against the
	versions created as part of staging the release.
     -# Also upload doc/openocd.pdf (the User's Guide) so the version
        matching each release will be easily available.
     -# Select each file in the release, and use the property panel
        to set its type and select the right release notes.
       - .tar.bz2: Linux, Mac
       - .tar.gz: BSD, Solaris, Others
       - .zip: Windows
       - For openocd.pdf just associate it with the right release notes.
     -# Create an SF.net project news update.
  -# Depending on how paranoid you're feeling today, verify the images by
     downloading them from the websites and making sure there are no
     differences between the downloaded copies and your originals.
  -# Publish User's and Developer's Guides to the project web sites:
     -# Use SCP to update the SF.net web site with PDF and HTML for the
          User's Guide, and HTML for the developer's guide ... you can
	  instantiate a shell.sourceforge.net instance and set up symlinks
	  from your home directory, to simplify this process.
  -# Post announcement e-mail to the openocd-development list.
  -# optionally:
     -# Post an update on the OpenOCD blog.
     -# Announce updates on freshmeat.net and other trackers.
     -# Submit updates to news feeds (e.g. Digg, Reddit, etc.).
-# Resume normal development on mainline, by opening the merge window for
  the next major or minor release cycle.  (You might want to do this
  before all the release bits are fully published.)
  - Update the version label in the @c configure.ac file:
     - Restore @c -dev version tag.
     - For a new minor release cycle, increment the release's minor number
     - For a new major release cycle, increment the release's major number
       and zero its minor number
  - Archive @c NEWS file as "<code>doc/news/NEWS-${PACKAGE_VERSION}</code>".
  - Create a new @c NEWS file for the next release
  - Commit those changes.
  - Push all the updates to mainline.
     - Last updates for the release, including the release tag (you
       will need to "git push --tags").
     - Updates opening the merge window
  - At this point, it's OK for commiters to start pushing changes
    which have been held off until the next release.  (Any bugfixes to
    this release will be against a bug-fix release branch starting from
    the commit you tagged as this release, not mainline.)
  - Announce to the openocd-development list.  Ideally, you will also
    be able to say who is managing the next release cycle.

To start a bug-fix release branch:
-# Create a new branch, starting from a major or
   minor release tag
-# Restore @c -dev version tag.
-# Bump micro version number in configure.ac
-# Backport bugfix patches from mainline into that branch.
   (Always be sure mainline has the fix first, so it's hard
   to just lose a bugfix.)
-# Commit and push those patches.
-# When desired, release as above ... except note that the next
   release of a bugfix branch is never a new major or minor release

@subsection releasescriptcmds Release Script Commands

The @c release.sh script automates some of the steps involved
in making releases, simplifying the Release Manager's work.

The release script can be used for two tasks:
- Creating releases and starting a new release cycle:
@code
git checkout master
tools/release.sh --type=minor --final --start-rc release
@endcode
- Creating a development branch from a tagged release:
@code
git checkout 'v0.2.0'
tools/release.sh --type=micro branch
@endcode

Both of these variations make automatic commits and tags in your
repository, so you should be sure to run it on a cloned copy before
proceding with a live release.

@subsection releasescriptopts Release Script Options

The @c release.sh script recognizes some command-line options that
affect its behavior:

- The @c --start-rc indicates that the new development release cycle
  should start with @c -rc0.  Without this, the @c -rc tag will be omitted,
  leading to non-monotonic versioning of the in-tree version numbers.
- The @c --final indicates that the release should drop the @c -rc tag,
  to going from @c x.y.z-rcN-dev to x.y.z.

@subsection releasescriptenv Release Script Environment

The @c release.sh script recognizes some environment variables which
affect its behavior:

- @c CONFIG_OPTS : Passed as options to the configure script.
- @c MAKE_OPTS : Passed as options to the 'make' processes.

@section releasetutorial Release Tutorials

This section should contain a brief tutorial for using the Release
Script to perform release tasks, but the new script needs to be
used for 0.3.0.

@section releasetodo Release Script Shortcomings

Improved automated packaging and distribution of OpenOCD requires more
patching of the configure script.  The final release script should be
able to manage most steps of the processes.  The steps requiring user
input could be guided by an "assistant" that walks the Release Manager
through the process from beginning to end, performing basic sanity
checks on their various inputs (e.g. the @c NEWS blurb).
