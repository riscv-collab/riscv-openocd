# This is the pre v0.3 Floss-JTAG compatible config file. It can also be used
# for newer versions of Floss-JTAG with empty or not populated EEPROM. If you
# have several Floss-JTAG connected you have to use the USB ID to select a
# specific one.
#
# If you have a Floss-JTAG WITH EEPROM that is programmed, use the
# flossjtag.cfg file.
