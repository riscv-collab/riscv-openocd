# On CC32xx family of devices, sysreqreset is disabled, and vectreset is
# blocked by the boot loader (stops in a while(1) statement). srst reset can
# leave the target in a state that prevents debug. The following uses the
# soft_reset_halt command to reset and halt the target. Then the PC and stack
# are initialized from internal flash. This allows for a more reliable reset,
# but with two caveats: it only works for the SF variant that has internal
# flash, and it only resets the CPU and not any peripherals.
